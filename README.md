## Hi there 
My name is Mikko Vasankari and welcome to my GitHub profile. <br>
Currently I am a IT-student trying to find my path in Software Development.<br>
Here in my profile you might find some of my own hobby projects as well as projects from my studies.

My current interests are:
  - This book called [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
